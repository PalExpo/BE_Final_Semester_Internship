### Project Title: Implementation of Motor Control using ARM Cortex-M7 Microcontroller

## Introduction
This repository contains the project report and poster of my Bachelor of Engineering's final semester internship, which I completed at the Space Application Center (SAC) of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in Ahmedabad. The project involved implementing motor control using an ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller, LX7720 motor controller, and a BLDC motor.

## Project Overview
In this project, I worked on implementing motor control using an ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller, LX7720 motor controller, and a BLDC motor. The aim of the project was to develop a control system that could regulate the speed and direction of the BLDC motor based on user input, using field-oriented control with a PI controller and space vector pulse width modulation. The project involved designing and implementing the software that would run on the microcontroller using MPLAB X IDE with XC32 Compiler and Harmonyv3 Configurator, as well as testing and optimizing the system's performance. For simulation, MATLAB & Simulink were used.
